Done treating metals
Assigning bond orders...
  Using CCD: True
CCD template assignment failed for HET "B49 " due to:
  Failed to generate a CT from SMILES: CCN(CC)CCNC(=O)c1c(C)[nH]c(/C=C/2C(=O)Nc3ccc(F)cc/23)c1C
  Falling back to bond order assignment based on geometry.
  Assigned the following bonds (format: atom1, atom2, order): set([(2440, 2451, 2), (2432, 2433, 2), (2437, 2444, 2), (2443, 2446, 2), (2434, 2436, 2), (2435, 2445, 2), (2439, 2450, 2), (2438, 2442, 2)])
